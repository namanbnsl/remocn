# remocn Component Index

Router for the per-component reference files in this directory. **Scan this table to pick candidates, then open only the `components/<name>.md` files you actually need** — do not read every file.

Columns: **Use for** / **Avoid for** are the first signal from each file's `## Use when` / `## Don't use when`. Read the file for the full prop table, example, and all bullets.

Install any entry: `shadcn add @remocn/<name>` (lands at `components/remocn/<name>.tsx`; deps auto-install).
