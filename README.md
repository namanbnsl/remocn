# Remocn

remocn is a copy-paste component library for building videos in Remotion. Instead of writing every fade, wipe, and kinetic title from scratch, you `npx shadcn add` a polished primitive into your project and own the code. Built for solo builders and small teams who need a product demo video shipped today, not next week.

## Why remocn

- **Remotion has no batteries-included component library** You either build every animation from scratch or copy snippets from blog posts. remocn gives you a curated registry of primitives and full scenes that just work.
- **Polished motion is hard** Easing curves, spring physics, transition timing - remocn ships components that already feel right, so you can focus on storytelling instead of tuning `interpolate()` calls.
- **You own the code** Components are copied into your repo (shadcn philosophy). No runtime dependency, no version lock-in, no black box - tweak anything you want.
- **Solo builders need demo videos fast** Compose a launch trailer, changelog clip, or feature walkthrough from prebuilt blocks in an afternoon.

## remocn/ui

`remocn/ui` is a separate registry of **timeline-driven UI primitives** — the components you'd reach for in shadcn (Button, Dialog, Dropdown Menu, Tabs, Command Menu, Toast…), but rebuilt for video. Every state change is keyframe-driven instead of event-driven: a primitive plays through its open/close, focus, hover, and selection states on the Remotion timeline, so you can animate a real UI walkthrough — a signup form filling in, a dropdown opening, a checkout completing — frame by frame.

All atoms share one core lib (`remocn-ui`) and follow the same steps API, so they compose into full flows: **Signup**, **Checkout**, and **Settings Toggle** ship ready to drop into a scene.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @remocn/ui-dropdown-menu
```

The atom lands in `components/remocn/ui-dropdown-menu.tsx`, pulls in the `remocn-ui` core lib, and is yours to edit.

## Installation

Remotion is a prerequisite — set up a Remotion project first if you don't have one (`npx create-video@latest`). Then add any component from the registry:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @remocn/blur-reveal
```

The component lands in `components/remocn/blur-reveal.tsx` and is yours to edit.
